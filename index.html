  <h2>What's <strong>eurucamp</strong>?</h2>

  <p>Just like you, we noticed a huge amount of interest in <a
  href="http://euruko2011.org/">EuRuKo</a> this year and a lot of people
  (including the organisers of <strong>eurucamp</strong>) weren't able to get
  tickets.</p>

  <p>So we're assembling an alternative programme for those who want to come
    to Berlin and hear about, talk about and hack about (with) Ruby.</p>

  <p>What we're planning to do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A Barcamp-style event consisting of workshops and hack-spaces.</li>
    <li>Depending on interest, an alternative line up of talks.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As far as possible, we'll coordinate the social events with the EuRuKo
  organisers, so you'll still have a chance to meet up with those attending.</p>
