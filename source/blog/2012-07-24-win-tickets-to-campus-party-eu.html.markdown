Coming to Berlin the week following eurucamp is Campus Party EU, and eurucamp is happy to be a partner with the event.

If eurucamp has whetted your appetite, then check out what is billed as the "largest technology festival in the world". Campus Party EU is focussed on innovation, creativity, science and digital entertainment.

For one whole one week, courses, hackathons, and workshops will be held 24 hours a day. Speakers will include Paulo Coelho and Tim Berners-Lee.

This event was held for many years in Valencia, rallying young and not so young people from across Spain. Campus Parties subsequently followed in other Ibero-American countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Brazil.

eurucamp has teamed up with Campus Party in a couple of ways:

* Together, we will be offering **50% discount** on Campus Party tickets for all eurucamp attendees. If you have already registered for eurucamp, then we will be in touch with more information on how to obtain the discount.
* We are having a draw for **20 free tickets**. The draw opens today, and runs until the 31st of July.


We hope to see there!
