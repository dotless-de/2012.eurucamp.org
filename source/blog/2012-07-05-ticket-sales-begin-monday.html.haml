  eurucamp has always been designed to be accessible for all. While we're more
  expensive than last year, we should still be affordable for everyone who wants
  to come. We're planning a very ambitious programme of talks and activities.


  What's included in the ticket price:

  - **activities**: talks and outdoor activities.
  - **great coffee, drinks, snacks and meals**


  What's not included in the ticket price:

  - **accommodation**: you need to decide for yourself where you want to stay.
    We'll be updating our [venue page][venue] over the next week with more
    details about the options available to you.
  - **transport to/and from the venue**: you'll have to buy your own tickets.
   there will be a small charge for the CampBus.
  - **equipment rental for some activities**


  There will be no early-bird discounts. However, we expect the first batch to
  sell out fast.

  There will be a discount of 30% for students and unemployed.
